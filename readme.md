**Spring Initializer**

```aidl

I use it to create Spring Projects.


(I most importantly set the dependencies.


```

**pom xml**

```aidl

This is where we store the Project dependencies.


SRC

This is the main project folder.

(a)JAVA--Where we write our code

(b)Test Folder---where we write all our application tests.


(c)Application.properties--->Where i store all my application
variables.



```

We use services to Write our busness Logic and Insert them to our
Controllers.
